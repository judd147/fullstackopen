# Introduction
Stores all files that are submitted to the fullstackopen course. Please note that the folders only contain source files like App.js and db.json. If you wish to test out the Apps, run create-react-app command and replace the files accordingly.

## Part 1
In this part, three naive examples of React App were implemented. Since index.js remains the same, it's put outside the folders.

## Part 2
In this part, concepts of communicating with the server were demonstrated in the Apps using Axios. In particular, the notes app is the running example during the course. The phonebook app is a rather complete excercise for this part.

## Part 3
In this part, backend/server programming was introduced using Node.js and Express and the data is stored in MongoDB Cloud. In addition, middleware was introduced and utilized. Finally, a production build of frontend was placed in the backend folder which would be deployed using hosting service like Render.io. Now, note and phonebook are both fullstack CRUD apps.

## Part 4
In this part, Jest was introduced to facilitate backend testing. Meanwhile, the codespace was refactored to different files and a testing environment/db was set up. After that, async/await syntax replaced .then() functions. Finally, "auth" was added to both note and bloglist applications.
